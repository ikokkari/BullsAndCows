# BullsAndCows
Game of Bulls and Cows played with English language words instead of integers.

A fun, educational and interesting programming exercise that offers something for everybody in the CS1/CS2 course. The task is to write a player that guesses the secret word based on how many bulls (right letter in right place) and cows (right letter in wrong place) each previous guess contained. Given this information, which words are still possible words as the secret word, and which one of these remaining words would be the most powerful guess to reveal new information about the secret word?
